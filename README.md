# ecrawlers

ecrawlers (Expert Crawlers) contains the Python code that allows you to use three different crawlers. All are linked to
the world of cybersecurity and in particular to software vulnerabilities and will be used by the University of Trieste
and the University of Turin for research purposes.

In each folder there is a `README.md` which describes the operation, parameters and data obtained from each crawler.
