# cve-crawler

This is a web crawler that downloads all existing [CVE from MITRE](https://cve.mitre.org/). It can be used both as a
normal Python program and via Docker.

## Parameters

When it starts downloading for the first time, it will start from the first existing CVEs, dating back to 1999. If its
execution is interrupted, at its next execution, if the output folder is the same, it will start again from the last
downloaded one. If all CVEs are downloaded completely, the script will download new data once every `update_interval`
seconds (default is 21600 seconds).

it is also possible to configure the `path_storage` path (default is `/usr/src/data`) in which to save the downloaded
files, the timeout `request_timeout` for a single request (default is 10 seconds) and the `retry_interval` time (default
is 3600 seconds), in case the rate limit is reached.

It should also be noted that the update is based on [xml files ](https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/), which contain
all the CVEs for each year. These files are downloaded and saved, but only those relating to the
last `n_years_redownload` (default is 4) are redownloaded in order to have the most updated data, as it is more likely
that there will be changes.

## Usage

Running without Docker can be done as a regular Python program (conda or venv). Simply install the requirements via `pip
install requirements.txt`.

Running via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), however, obviously requires its installation. The build must then be
performed via:

```
docker build --tag cve-crawler .
```

Subsequently, you can run the application via:

```
docker run --restart unless-stopped -v <local output directory>:/usr/src/data cve-crawler
```

### Output folder

The files are saved in the specified folder and are organized by year, month and then a jsonl file per day. The date
refers to how much the CVE in question has been reserved.

It should be noted that for correct execution, a (hidden) file is created and used, called `last_cve.txt`, in which the
next CVE to be downloaded is saved. If this file is deleted, the download will start again from the beginning the next
time the software is run (only if not already running).
